1. Explain how the CPU provides concurrency or parallelism:
    The CPU distributes responses for commands into several different tasks that then run all at once. Basically just distribution of workload.

2. Describe assembly language and machine language:
    Assembly is like machine but uses a compiler for more readability, introducing variable names to be handled by the compiler into machine language later.
    Machine is the code that is ran by the CPU directly and is made up of only numbers.
